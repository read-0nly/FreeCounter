# FreeCounter
Android counter app with widget, free and no ads

### Next Steps
 - ~Multi-widget support~
 - Better visuals < Widget mocked, missing main interface
 - Auto-save at day end < Instead, add timestamp as count? Remap to show count of the day. That way you get to review the date/time of every count, do graphing from by-the-minute to by-the-year
 - CSV export < Will need file permission
 - ~Graphing, some analysis~
 - Goal setting < just add a Goal key, and a targetDirection
 - Never ads < Still no ads
